4. Relevant Information from:
  
   --- This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern
       recognition literature.  Fisher's paper is a classic in the field
       and is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for
       example.)  The original data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each,
       where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is
       linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly
       separable from each other.
   --- Predicted attribute: class of iris plant.
   --- This is an exceedingly simple domain.
   --- This data differs from the data presented in Fishers article as two errors have been detected
	(identified by Steve Chadwick,  spchadwick@espeedaz.net )
  --- This dataset has been further modified to serve the final project in the BINF601 course
