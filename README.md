# Practical AI/ML for Computational Biology and Chemistry Workshop

Research is being revolutionized by methods from the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML). AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes (such as problem-solving, learning, and planning) by machines, while ML, a type of artificial intelligence, gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed. They have been applied in many areas including drug discovery, protein folding, and identification of variants from genetic data.

This workshop will provide you with

- a conceptual understanding of various AI/ML approaches,
- examples of practical applications of AI/ML in computational biology and chemistry,
- hands-on exercises with emphasis on the importance of data preparation and readiness for AI/ML.

Through introductory lectures, you will be exposed to the basic concepts behind AI/ML approaches to better understand the practical applications of these data science tools, including what types of data can be used for a specific approach, and what types of outcomes can be expected. The illustrative practical applications will help you understand how these tools can be used in your research project. You will also learn about the importance of preparing the data according to the FAIR principles, namely, Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. This will be addressed by providing you with first-hand experience on the issues arising when data that is not well-prepared, and covering various data formats, processing and wrangling techniques to get the data into a form where it can be utilized by Machine Learning algorithms. You will learn different visualization techniques to better understand the data at hand.

## Requirements

Bring your computer. Live demos and hands-on exercises will involve coding using Google Colaboratory notebooks. Basic Python programming is recommended but not required.

## Sponsors

Hosted by the UD Chemistry-Biology Interface Program and Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. This workshop is offered free of charge with support from the NIH National Institute for General Medical Sciences (T32GM133395-03S1).
